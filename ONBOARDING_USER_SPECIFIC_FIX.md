# Onboarding User-Specific Storage Fix

## Problem
When a new user logged in, the onboarding name entry box was showing the previous user's entered name instead of being empty. This happened because onboarding data was stored in AsyncStorage without being tied to a specific user.

## Root Cause
The `OnboardingContext` was using a single storage key (`onboardingData`) for all users, causing data from previous users to persist when new users accessed the onboarding flow.

## Solution
Modified the onboarding system to use user-specific storage keys and added proper user detection.

### Changes Made

#### 1. OnboardingContext.js
- **Added user-specific storage keys**: Storage keys now include the user ID (e.g., `onboardingData_${user.id}`)
- **Added `getStorageKey()` function**: Returns the appropriate storage key based on current user
- **Updated `useEffect` dependency**: Now reloads data when user ID changes
- **Enhanced `loadOnboardingData()`**: Properly resets data when no stored data exists for current user
- **Updated all storage operations**: `saveOnboardingData()`, `completeOnboarding()`, and `resetOnboarding()` now use user-specific keys
- **Added `isOnboardingComplete()` function**: Checks completion status for current user

#### 2. Step1Name.js
- **Enhanced `useEffect`**: Now checks for both onboarding data AND authenticated user before loading name
- **Added user ID dependency**: Component re-renders when user changes
- **Added fallback**: Clears name field when no user is authenticated or no data exists

### Key Benefits
1. **Data Isolation**: Each user's onboarding data is completely separate
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: When a new user logs in, old data doesn't interfere
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy storage keys are still supported for existing users
4. **Better UX**: New users always start with a clean onboarding experience

### Storage Key Pattern
- **Authenticated users**: `onboardingData_${userId}` and `onboardingComplete_${userId}`
- **Anonymous users**: `onboardingData` and `onboardingComplete` (legacy)

### Testing
To test the fix:
1. Complete onboarding with User A
2. Log out and log in as User B
3. Navigate to onboarding Step 1
4. Verify the name field is empty (not showing User A's name)

## Files Modified
- `interview-app/context/OnboardingContext.js`
- `interview-app/screens/onboarding/Step1Name.js`

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - New users will now see an empty name field instead of previous user's data.
